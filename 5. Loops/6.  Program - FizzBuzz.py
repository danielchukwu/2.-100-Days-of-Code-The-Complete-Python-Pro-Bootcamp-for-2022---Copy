# Python - 3.10
# Topic - FizzBuzz Program
# program - write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
# Rule:
# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
# And if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"



# program - doneâœ…


# process: use of if conditional statements in our for loop
for number in range(1, 101):
   if (number % 3 == 0) and (number % 5 == 0):
      print("FizzBuzz")
   elif (number % 3 == 0):
      print("Fizz")
   elif (number % 5 == 0):
      print("Buzz")
   else:
      print(number)
